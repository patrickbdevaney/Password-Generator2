# Password-Generator2

The following is a random password generator using the pseudo-random "math.random" method. The user can choose from special characters, lowercase letters, capital letters, or numbers with a password ranging in length from 8 to 128 characters. The user receives a prompt asking how long the password should and a follwoing prompt of what kind of character is desired. An if statement checks if the user input lowercase and then substitutes uppercase, numerical, and then special characters drawn from sets in that order. An alert returns the password.
